    <div> <p>We (Vita Haas and Lucy Weisner) have been friends since high school in Brooklyn, New York. We attended college together where we talked incessantly about working on collaborative fashion projects.</p>

<p>When we moved back to New York after college, we conceived Café Forgot. We were inspired by the many friends who were making incredible clothes and accessories yet did not have an outlet for their work here. Our goal was to create a dynamic space to show and share truly interesting fashion and to hold special events to introduce these designers to a wider community. </p>

<p>Since beginning the project in 2017, Café Forgot has taken form as a series of ephemeral shops throughout New York with a DIY aesthetic and a quasi-punk ethos. We continue to encourage friends and customers to come to our shop, hang out, dress up in our clothes, and have fun.  Many of the designers we work with make one-of-a-kind pieces, so it’s great to have them come in to the shop and tell us how each design came to fruition and for everyone to try on the garments. </p>

<p>As spawn of the internet age, we are in sync with the virtual world. Editorials and photo shoots on Instagram have been central to our project. You may also take a look at the photoshoots in the archive on this website to see what we have done recently. Additionally, if you would like a copy of our hardcover, November 2018, Picture Book, please email us at the contact below. Finally, if you have any questions or comments in general please feel free to email or dm us.</p>
