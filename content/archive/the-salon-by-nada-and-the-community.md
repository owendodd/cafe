The Salon by NADA & The Community is an invitational art fair that took place Thursday, October 17th through Sunday, October 20th, 2024 in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. No Agency and Café Forgot export the energy of downtown NYC’s fashion scene curating a selection of sculptural works from the Cafe Forgot's roster of visual-artists-turned-designers.
