Exploring the invisible yet vital mycelial networks of natural ecosystems, PLĀS collective pushes the boundaries of textile experimentation inoculating woven and knit fabric with mushroom spores. On Saturday March 29, Café Forgot hosted the launch of PLĀS Collective's imaginative SS25 collection, Mycelia.  To accompanying the launch PLĀS created a wall-length vinyl installation featuring an atmospheric campaign shot by photographer Lula Hyers.
