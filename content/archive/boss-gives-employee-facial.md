The opening party for Mara Mckevitt’s installation based in the speculative landscape of her film-in-progress “Boss Gives Employee Facial.”

Set in a futuristic ‘girls only’ apartment complex called Our Place, this erotic thriller follows employee, Liv Cameron (Ripley Soprano), the complex’s receptionist by day and cam-girl by night. Liv sells in-suite surveillance footage to afford her rent (like her fellow residents) and her own specialized content to earn an income. The conditions of her work-life are periodically managed by an HR bot (Bianca Perez). Unbeknownst to Liv, her boss and property manager, Lisa Landers (stand-in: Brynn Michaels) chooses her as a test subject for Our Place’s new experimental device. Liv undergoes beta-testing for X-link, a new biotechnological pleasure instrument, which allows users to experience other people’s orgasms. In Lisa’s prospective business plan, members buy, sell and trade orgasms, while \[redacted\]—a small class of people affluent enough to purchase unsurveilled, private time—are X-Link’s primary consumer. In navigating this not-so-distant reality, Liv comes to terms with the illusion of consent protecting an enduring nexus of labor, pleasure and identity.

The first collection of garments based on the film will be available at Café Forgot. Each variation: EMPLOYEE, RESIDENT, CONTENT, BOSS, MEMBER, and \[REDACTED\], refer to stratas of class and labor relations structuring the world of ‘Boss Gives Employee Facial.’
