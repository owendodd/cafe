On Thursday July 15 we hosted a celebration and reading from “VENUS JUICE: When I Tried To Live in LA” by author and healer, Luke Simon.

ABOUT VENUS JUICE:

VENUS JUICE takes readers on a neo-nostalgic trip into the LA wellness scene of the late 2010s, a land of luxury juice, natural healing, and digital hookups. On the surface the City of Angels seems to hold the keys to all that Luke seeks—love, creativity and how to make it as an Instagram healer. But is everything what it seems?

Known in wellness circles as a co-founder of the popular Maha Rose Center for Healing in Brooklyn, Simon’s story takes in themes of friendship, celebrity, queer romance, and the social media hustle that has come to color our experiences in the new millennium.

An incisive portrait and loving parody of a city where glossy facades often conceal darker hidden truths, VENUS JUICE is populated with a colorful cast of coaches, artists, hunks, healers, influencers, nighttime flowers, and health food connoisseurs. At the center of it all, we find one soul learning the meaning of self-love in our increasingly divided and digitized world.
