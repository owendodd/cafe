In this moment of unprecedented isolation, when connection and community tend to be mediated by a screen, Café Forgot presents a night of stories, poems, and essays mediated by a screen with Bobbi Salvör Menuez, Coco Gordon Moore, Gideon Jacobs, Rebekah Campbell, Stepahanie LaCava, and Yves B. Golden.

Wednesday November 11 at 7 pm EST on Zoom. [**_TICKETS_**](https://shop.cafeforgot.com/product/screen-dreams/2439?cp=true&sa=true&sbp=false&q=false "tickets")**_._**
