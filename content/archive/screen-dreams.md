In this moment of unprecedented isolation, when connection and community tend to be mediated by a screen, Café Forgot presented a night of stories, poems, and essays mediated by a screen with Bobbi Salvör Menuez, Coco Gordon Moore, Gideon Jacobs, Rebekah Campbell, Stepahanie LaCava, and Yves B. Golden.
