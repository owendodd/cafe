Designer Renea LaRiviere founded the concept for her line in 2018 as an ode to her Great Grandmother Zepherina. A combined influence of familial photographs, stories, and heirlooms constructed her character of Zepherina. This narrative is illustrated in her collection of limited-edition silhouettes, crafted with premium textiles and one-of-a-kind details for a mysterious-yet-sophisticated look. This March, for _A Narrative Room_, Renea will create an immersive installation of found furniture, art objects, and one-of-a-kind garments, featuring work by Claudia Cruz, Daisy Chains, and Ty & Calla. The result will be an enchanted space that the character Zepherina would inhabit. 

Opening Party Mar 9 7—10 PM with a selection of natural wines by Berlin & Zev Rovine Selections.
