Café Forgot presents SIDE EFFECT imagined by Jade Forrest Marks + Cara Marie Piazza.

Join us for our opening fête on the evening of Thursday March 19th co-hosted by queer cooking collective, Spiral Theory Test Kitchen. Delight in a Cum Over Cake by 69herbs + STTK, made with aphrodisiac and heart opening herbs. Shroud and immerse yourself in a sonically charged dye bath installation by Cara Marie Piazza and Emil Bognar-Nasdor. Color changing libations and spiked kombucha as well as edible treats will be provided.

Beginning Friday Mar 20, Jade Forrest Marks of 69herbs curates a weekend of fantasy, faggotry, and frivolity. Join us for a series of workshops and offerings bridging the worlds of herbalism, somatics, fashion, harm reduction and art. Events include private reiki sessions with lily bo shapiro, gua sha with Yarrow Medicine, an embodied movement workshop with Marisa Hall, flower essences of the spring equinox with 69herbs, sculptures from found flora with Fleurotica, harm redux kit making with Ripley Soprano, and a plant essence and bundle dyed underwear workshop with Jade Forrest Marks + Cara Marie Piazza.

Then starting Mar 22, Natural Dyer and artist Cara Marie Piazza presents an installation of remnant stitched and sonically charged clothing, steeped in rain and patched together from the fragments of her practice. Experience color as your antidote.

There will be a curated selection of objects by Cadis Made, Vessels by Alyse Gagnon, Terra Quilting Co bags and more!
