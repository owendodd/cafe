Cafe Forgot presents SIDE EFFECT

imagined Jade Forrest Marks + Cara Marie Piazza.

Join us for our opening fête on the evening of Thursday March 19th co-hosted by a queer cooking collective, Spiral Theory Test Kitchen. Delight in a Cum Over Cake by 69herbs + STTK, made with aphrodisiac and heart opening herbs. Shroud and immerse yourself in a sonically charged dye bath installation by Cara Marie Piazza and Emil Bognar Nasdor. Color changing libations and spiked kombucha as well as edible treats will be provided.

Beginning Friday 3/20, Jade Forrest Marks of 69herbs curates a weekend of fantasy, faggotry, and frivolity. Join us for a series of workshops and offerings bridging the worlds of herbalism, somatics, fashion, harm reduction and art. Events include private reiki sessions with Lily Bo Shapiro, A Gua Sha workshop with Frankie baker, fairy glitter bath salts workshop with Jade Forrest Marks and Teva Livne, an embodied movement workshop with Marisa Hall, an equinox flower essence making workshop with Jade Forrest Marks, a floral arranging workshop with Robin Rose Hillary of Fleurotica, a harm reduction workshop with Ripley Soprano, and a plant essence + bundle dyed underwear workshop with Jade Forrest Marks + Cara Marie Piazza.

Then starting 3/22, Natural Dyer and artist Cara Marie Piazza presents an installation of remnant stitched and sonically charged clothing, steeped in rain and patched together from the fragments of her practice. Experience color as your antidote. Her week consists of A night of FDA disapproved readings from Gideon Jacobs, Lexie Smith, and David Lindsay, a Petrichorous Moon Water Ceremony, a sonic catharsis involving live vocals, live score and intention setting with artists Nat Marcus, Venïson Man and Yves B Golden.

There will be a curated selection of objects by Cadis Made, Vessels by Alyse Gagnon, Terra Quilting Co bags and more.
