On July 26, Café Forgot launched a line of logo t-shirts. Each tee is screen-printed inside out on hand-sourced dead-stock vintage blanks with the CF logo on the front and the number 170 on the back. For Café Forgot founders, Vita Haas and Lucy Weisner, 170 is a magical number essential to the store’s founding in 2017.  Logo tees are availabe to purchase here.
