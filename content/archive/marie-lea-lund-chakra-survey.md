This is an [**_anonymous survey_**](https://lucyweisner.typeform.com/to/aVhysi "survey") regarding physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. It is based on the chakra system and made to measure the balance of each of the seven main energy centers in the body. The final results of the survey will be treated as an indication of the overall health of the Café Forgot community. This will act as a foundation for a collection by designer and artist Marie Lea Lund, who is working with a methodology of integrating holistic and spiritual care to fashion objects.
