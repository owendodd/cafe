Marie Lea Lund is an artist and designer based in Berlin, Germany. She created an anonymous survey based on the chakra system and made to measure the balance of each of the seven main energy centers in the body. The final results of the survey will be treated as an indication of the overall health of the Café Forgot community. The results will act as a foundation for a collection by Marie, who is working with a methodology of integrating holistic and spiritual care to fashion objects. Stay tuned for the collection.
