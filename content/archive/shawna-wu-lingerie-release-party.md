On Thursday February 9 NYC-based, Taiwanese artist, Shawna Wu launched a new collection of lingerie and ready-to-wear at Café Forgot.

Shawna Wu’s work is informed by Chinese ancestral practices of knotting and artisanal textile-making. Her butterfly knot harnesses inspired by the Chinese myth of the butterfly lovers alongside hand-knotted and beaded lingerie sets, hand-knotted fringed ‘whip’ skirts and panel tops in baby pink and black were available for sale at the event.

Shawna Wu also debuted inclusive lingerie sets: matching bra and panties that come in both ‘flat’ and ‘pouch’ cuts. These inclusive lingerie sets aim to fill a gap in the market by catering to diverse bodies and are made sustainably from rare dead-stock lace.

Alongside the collection, Café Forgot displayed an interior wall-length billboard with Shawna Wu’s campaign imagery and a light installation by queer lighting collective Wildblur, best known for illuminating Brooklyn’s underground raves like the monthly sksksk and annual gay festival Honcho Campout. Poet Rachel Oyster Kim’s latest chapbook was available at the event.
