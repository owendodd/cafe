In this virtual healing group, live on Zoom, Luke Simon led participants in a Breathwork journey to shake off restlessness and worry, and move forward with courage, creativity and trust.

Breathwork is an active meditation that takes you out of the mind and into feeling. The increased oxygen flow shifts your brain chemistry, helping old emotions to release and new understanding to dawn.
