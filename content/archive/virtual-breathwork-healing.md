In this virtual healing group, live on Zoom, Luke will lead you in a Breathwork journey to shake off restlessness and worry, and move forward with courage, creativity and trust. This is a reboot for your energy body. It’s ok if you’re tender, angry, or unsure, it’s all welcome here and it is going to move and change in this healing group.

Breathwork is an active meditation that takes you out of the mind and into feeling. The increased oxygen flow shifts your brain chemistry, helping old emotions to release and new understanding to dawn. Come ready to experience the subtle energy inside of you. You’ll leave feeling lighter, balanced, and more who you really are.
