A guided journey to ground yourself and open your intuition. Connect to the essence of your style with prompts to uncover the colors, textures and looks your spirit is craving. Uniting intuition with appreciation for life, we receive new visions for ourselves and the planet. Guided by [Luke Simon](lukesimonmystic.com "Luke Simon") with music by [Deta Factor](https://www.instagram.com/jxpoll/ "Deta Factor") & [Matthewdavid](https://www.instagram.com/matthewdavidmcq/ "Matthewdavid")
