A party in honor of Ben Doctor's Spring Summer 2024 runway collection entitled, "Rotten Goodbye."Â  In the words of Ben Doctor: "I'm saying goodbye to New York. Not really, hopefully, but what I mean is that I'm saying goodbye to what we all imagine New York to be, which can only exist in your head. It's the New York you see while watching Sex and the City, where everyone is so chic and epic. And life is affordable. New York is full of experiences, some better than others, but there are plenty of rotten ones, and sometimes you just have to say goodbye."
