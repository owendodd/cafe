Hosted by _Jzuj_ –the collaborative cooking project of graphic designer Owen Dodd and chef Nicholas Sewitz–temporary wine bar spanned two evenings, providing snacks and a selection of natural wines. Charlotte Jackson, an opera soprano, provided live accompaniment on the final night of the wine bar, singing selected arias from the 17th-20th centuries.
