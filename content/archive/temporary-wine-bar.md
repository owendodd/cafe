Hosted by _Jzuj_ – the collaborative cooking project of graphic designer, Owen Dodd and chef Nicholas Sewitz, the temporary wine bar spanned two evenings. The gastronomists provided a tasty selection of their homemade pickles and other delicious snacks which they paired with a selection of delightful natural wines. On the second night of the wine bar, opera soprano, Charlotte Jackson, provided live accompaniment, performing selected arias from the 17th-20th centuries.
