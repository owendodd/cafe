EDIE is the work of our longtime friend, Edie Hanly. Her line is inspired by her father’s eclectic collection of gingham, plaid, and seersucker suits. Her green and white checkered pants are Café favorites as are her cosy slouch jackets. Best of all, her pieces are super flattering  on every body type.
