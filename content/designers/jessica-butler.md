Jessica Butler is a New York-based visual artist, poet, and photo editor at Artforum magazine. Butler cuts up old issues of Sassy mag to spell out sweet ransom notes, which she applies to chokers. She also makes necklaces out of collaged photos of fairytale forests or spooky caves and childrenâ€™s knick-knacks like plastic frogs and spiders.
