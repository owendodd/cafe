Kayla Satzger is a London based womenswear designer. The brand explores the concept of being “in love” through notions of distortion and manipulation. With a Victorian-inspired approach, the collection aspires to be recognized for its emotional perspective, sensual tones, romantic artisanship, and expert draping techniques. Juxtaposing heavy and delicate fabrics, the collection is presented in wool, dress net and a variety of silk.
