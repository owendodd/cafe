FLOWER NAMES is naturally-dyed clothing and accessories for earthlings. Thrifted fabric is used to make one of a kind pieces, while other items are made in teeny tiny batches. Many colors are only available seasonally and some colors only appear once. Everything is hand-dyed and sewn by Jasmine Cindy.
