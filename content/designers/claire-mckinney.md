Based in New York and a graduate of Pratt Institute, Claire Mckinney’s one-of-a-kind garments explore materiality through construction and/ or collage. Some pieces deconstruct the “uniforms” of conformity: blue jeans, bomber jackets, work shoes and cotton blouses and rework them into new forms through elimination, reconfiguration and addition of color and materials.
