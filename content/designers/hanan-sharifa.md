Hanan Sharifa is a Brooklyn based artist working in a variety of materials and fabrics including re-purposed denim, mesh, jersey, and satin. In Arabic, Hanan means "tender" or "compassionate" , she includes her name on many of her garments in an effort to push against the English language as a global standard. Through this simple act, she is validating not only the Arabic language, but Muslim culture, and expression. Her garments often reveal unseen parts of the body as a way to reimagine the history of fabric into an intersectional contemporary narrative. Sharifa's garments are made for those with complex identities, unapologetic confidence and the desire to express one's true individuality.
