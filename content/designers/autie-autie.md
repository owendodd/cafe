Autie Carlisle (behind AutieAutie) wanted to work in fashion since she was 11. After nearly a dozen years of working in the industry Carlisle is exiting to pastures of nature and moving image. Carlisle's series with Caf√© Forgot is a nod to the beautiful people and experiences she encountered while working in the fashion industry.
