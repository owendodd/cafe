Autobody is a vintage inspired pants label created in 2014 by New Yorker and Pratt graduate, Cassie Goodman. Insanely comfortable, the pants have high waists and come in fly-off-the-shelves materials such as corduroy, pinstripe and vinyl. Best of all, the line is flattering on bodies of all shapes and sizes.
