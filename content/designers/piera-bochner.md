Piera Bochner is an artist and designer based in Brooklyn, New York, and a long-time friend of Vita and Lucy. Bochnerâ€™s candle project comes from a love of wax as a material and a desire to investigate how wicks, wax, and flames can travel down unconventional paths. As they burn, the colorful wax candles cast from romanesco broccoli and bitter melons become ever-changing sculptural forms.
