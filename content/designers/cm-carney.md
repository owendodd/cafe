CM Carney creates wearables for videoed or live performances, which focus on abstract, aestheticized characters and narratives. At Café Forgot, CM Carney’s quilted body coverings and translucent extra long-sleeved crop tops become sculptural relics of past performances while taking on a new, utilitarian purpose as wearable clothing.
