Carolyn Killcoyne Voyta draws inspiration from nostalgic play clothes, combining soft cottons and gingham with plaids, tartans and stripes to make bikinis, tops with tie waists, skirts and dresses that shouldnâ€™t work pattern-wise, yet do, and brilliantly! All her garments are made in the US using fabric from repurposed clothing.
