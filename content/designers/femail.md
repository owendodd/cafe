FEMAIL is the brainchild of Parsons graduates Janelle Abbott and Camilla Carper. After college, they moved to Seattle and Los Angeles respectively, but sought to keep their friendship and collaboration alive from afar by mailing garments and collage back and forth to one another. For FEMAIL, no garment is finished, but is always growing and expanding as more mementos and fragments are added to create new ideas about fashion in function and form.
