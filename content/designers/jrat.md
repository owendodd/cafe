JRAT is Janelle Rabbott, a Pacific Northwest native and Parsons School of Design graduate. She works exclusively in the “zero waste design methodology” ensuring that no waste is produced in the making of her products. Her work extends from sculpture, textiles, clothing, illustration, written words, to movement and dance. Her Café Forgot clothing features wide-cut pant legs and wrap-around tops and dresses that give license to vigorous movement, and her signature gray and fawn-colored textiles that are softened with frills and flower patterned overlays.
