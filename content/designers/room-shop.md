Room Shop started out as a vintage pop-up shop in the back bedroom of Shelly Horst and Dryw Scully’s Philadelphia row home. It has evolved into a sustainable line of apparel and accessories made from remnant, deadstock and overstock materials. Most famous for their Cloud Scrunchie, they are now delving into apparel design, keeping their commitment to sustainable design and responsible production. Room Shop’s products are made in Philadelphia, PA.
