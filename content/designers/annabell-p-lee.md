Based in Los Angeles, Annabell P Lee makes paintings, textiles, and clothing inspired by the materiality of color in vintage melamine and PVC. Lee hand dyes chunky checkerboard patterns and abstract designs in fire-engine red and navy blue on denim jackets, wrap tops, and rough-hewn lace-up grommet corsets.
