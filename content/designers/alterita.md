Our friend Layla Alter makes delicate and playful jewelry inspired by her collection of pendants: emblems from her travels. She launched her line, Alterita in 2018 inspired by her upbringing when dreaded winter days were spent dreaming of the ocean, yearning for summerâ€™s first swim; sandy, salted skin and raisined toes.
