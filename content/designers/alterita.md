Layla Alter launched her jewelry line, Alterita, in 2018 with translucent ruby-red fruits, peppers and cowrie shells dangling from delicate hoops, necklaces and anklets. Her work is inspired by her upbringing when dreaded winter days in New York were spent dreaming of the ocean and yearning for summerâ€™s first swim.
