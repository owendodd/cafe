HELENAMANZANO is a ready-to-wear line based in London. Manzano critiques the waste produced by the fashion industry through repurposing and recycling materials to create garments that reference the natural world. From a distance, her pieces often appear to be one-piece solid-colored constructions, yet, up close, they reveal themselves to be layered patterned fabrics overlaid with taupe, tan or black panels with unfinished, wispy edges and ends.
