SILPHIUM STUDIO, designed and developed by Onea Clare, is a one-person operation out of Brooklyn, New York. The STUDIO emphasizes reworked vintage and natural materials as a means to develop accessible and slow-story relationships with the client and garment. Inspired by post-modernist theory, gestural abstraction, and early 20th century fashion and furniture, Onea weaves her interests into one of a kind pieces.
