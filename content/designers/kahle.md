KAHLE, unadorned or bare in German, is a women's luxury clothing brand based in Brooklyn, New York. Mary Kahle works out of her Greenpoint studio making sustainable clothing for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes. Her line of clothes is remarkably versatile and functional: Each garment can be worn in many ways depending on how it is tied or whether the wearer sports it upside down or inside out.
