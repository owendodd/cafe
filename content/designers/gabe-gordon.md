Gabe Gordon is a Providence based knitwear designer currently pursuing his BFA at the Rhode Island School of Design. He is heavily inspired by the decay and nostalgia of worn cloth and his fabrics and garments are an assemblage of his own histories and memories. Each of his pieces are hand-loomed and dyed, made by using discarded yarns from local mills.
