Kristin Mallison is inspired by materials becoming something that they were never supposed to be. She fashions skirts and tops from old couch cushions, table runners and small donated needlepoint throw pillows. While the material is from the past, the cut and the style is from the future, and Mallisonâ€™s clothes become a contemporary synthesis of these two chronologies that is of the now.
