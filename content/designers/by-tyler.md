By Tyler, founded by New York-based designer, Tyler McGillivary, is a line of clothing to wiggle in. Her clothing, whether gauzy, flapjack-sized multicolored circles stitched together to make a top that dances before the eyes, or black, sheer, dresses punctuated by snake-like black twine that weaves around the wearers body, By Tyler will not be ignored.
