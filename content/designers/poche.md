Based in Los Angeles, Poche is an atelier that investigates the nuances and constructions of everyday wear and living. They explore the essence of relationships with dress, furnishings and homeware within the context of everyday life. Each piece is hand sewn or outsourced in small batches in Los Angeles as a means of demassification. Poche often uses dead-stock and recycled fabric to create distinctive season-less few-offs. Poche is for everyday use and everyday wear.
