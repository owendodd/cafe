Karla Laidlaw is a Melbourne based designer who creates one-off pieces and small runs of her garments. All garments are repurposed and reworkedâ€”dyed, bleached, painted, and sewn by hand. The designs are influenced by people who know who they are and use their personal style to express themselves.
