Paid Actor is the wearable extension of Dessislava Terzieva's fine art practice which is rooted in collage and found object sculpture. Terzeiva explores fashion as a form of communication, the body as a canvas, and the wearer as the messenger. Each piece has it's own unique narrative, whether it is in relation to the imagery/artwork featured on it, or the story behind the material(s) being used. Holistically, the very existence of these one-of-a-kind garments is a statement against fast fashion, trend worship and a look-alike culture fostered by social media.
