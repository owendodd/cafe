Founded in 2018, number sixteen is a Montreal-based label created by Kate McConnan. Informed by her education in textile arts and a family history of artisanship, she explores concepts of craft and womanhood to subvert stereotypes of feminine aesthetics and trends in fashion. Using carefully selected natural materials, each piece is handmade by Kate in her studio.
