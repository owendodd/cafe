Café Forgot found Martina Cox’s thesis work on Instagram soon after she graduated from Cooper Union, and, when they contacted her, she’d never sold her clothing in a store. She has since become a Café Forgot mainstay with her signature “window tops” which are shirts with clear plastic panels smack-dab over the breast, some of which feature movable curtains or miniature flower boxes to open and close as the wearer desires. The designer now lives in Berlin, but she ships her garments to us in New York for Café Forgot.
