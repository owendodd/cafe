Official Rebrand revives clothing that has been discarded, breathing new life into “waste”. Through painting and other alterations, non-binary designer MI Leggett's “rebranding” proposes a sustainable alternative to competitive consumption. The transformation of these pieces also reflect the fluidity of identity, dissociating garments from gendered categories, reintroducing them without arbitrary social constraints.
