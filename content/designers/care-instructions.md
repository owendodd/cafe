Care Instructions is the clothing project of Brooklyn-based textile artist Anne Symons. Symons naturally dyes swaths of silk and celebrates them through environmental installation and movement-driven works called Windpuppets. She then repurposes the material and combines it with found vintage textiles to make clothes and other wearables.
