Francesca Longo is a designer and illustrator born and raised in Brooklyn. Whether working in satin, silk or vinyl, she uses color, portraiture and volume to foster an aesthetic that projects new, radical notions of femininity. She loves Caf√© Forgot because she believes firmly in the slow, but novel pace of fashion that we engender.
