Delicate Porcelain is the collaborative project of musician Lila Gold and Josue Hurst. They tie-dye t-shirts and jeans and screen print psychedelic mushroom designs that read “mind, body, spirit, emotion.” Delicate Porcelain also creates nostalgic beaded jewelry that read “Be Kind” or “High in the Sky.” Lila Gold became involved with Café Forgot when she visited the shop, and since that meeting, she has collaborated with us many times and modeled for our editorial campaigns.
