Based in New York and a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Anna Pierceâ€™s references range from Victorian England to nostalgic childhood arts and crafts. Among other things, Pierce has produced jewelry from pasta, and corsets, chokers and bracelets of gingham and velvet, often adding details such as chains, charms, hearts and grommets.
