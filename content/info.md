CAFÉ FORGOT is a creative retail endeavor founded in 2017 by high school friends Vita Haas and Lucy Weisner focusing on the work of young and avant-garde designers with a DIY approach and slightly-punk ethos. CAFÉ FORGOT curates ephemeral shops throughout New York lasting between a week and two months. In each shop they host events such as a comedy night, a temporary wine bar, or a music performance. Also, CAFÉ FORGOT styles and directs editorial campaigns in conjunction with each shop. This website is an archive of their photoshoots.
