CAFÉ FORGOT is a creative retail endeavor founded in 2017 by childhood friends Vita Haas and Lucy Weisner focusing on the work of young and avant-garde designers with a DIY approach and slightly-punk ethos. CAFÉ FORGOT curates ephemeral shops throughout New York lasting anywhere between a few days to a few months. In each shop they host events such as comedy night, temporary wine bar, and music performances. Also, CAFÉ FORGOT styles and directs editorial campaigns in conjunction with each shop. This website is an archive of their photoshoots.
