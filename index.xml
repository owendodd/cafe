      <description>Designer Renea LaRiviere founded the concept for her line in 2018 as an ode to her Great Grandmother Zepherina. A combined influence of familial photographs, stories, and heirlooms constructed her character of Zepherina. This narrative is illustrated in her collection of limited-edition silhouettes, crafted with premium textiles and one-of-a-kind details for a mysterious-yet-sophisticated look. This March, for A Narrative Room, Renea will create an immersive installation of found furniture, art objects, and one-of-a-kind garments, featuring work by Claudia Cruz, Daisy Chains, and Ty &amp;amp; Calla.</description>

      <description>Official Rebrand revives clothing that has been discarded, breathing new life into “waste”. Through painting and other alterations, non-binary designer MI Leggett&amp;rsquo;s “rebranding” proposes a sustainable alternative to competitive consumption. The transformation of these pieces also reflect the fluidity of identity, dissociating garments from gendered categories, reintroducing them without arbitrary social constraints.</description>

      <description>Paid Actor is the wearable extension of Dessislava Terzieva&amp;rsquo;s fine art practice which is rooted in collage and found object sculpture. Terzeiva explores fashion as a form of communication, the body as a canvas, and the wearer as the messenger. Each piece has it&amp;rsquo;s own unique narrative, whether it is in relation to the imagery/artwork featured on it, or the story behind the material(s) being used. Holistically, the very existence of these one-of-a-kind garments is a statement against fast fashion, trend worship and a look-alike culture fostered by social media.</description>

While the material is from the past, the cut and the style is from the future, and Mallison’s clothes become a contemporary synthesis of these two chronologies that is of the now.</description>

      <description>We (Vita Haas and Lucy Weisner) have been friends since high school in Brooklyn, New York. We attended college together where we talked incessantly about working on collaborative fashion projects.
When we moved back to New York after college, we conceived Café Forgot. We were inspired by the many friends who were making incredible clothes and accessories yet did not have an outlet for their work here. Our goal was to create a dynamic space to show and share truly interesting fashion and to hold special events to introduce these designers to a wider community.</description>
